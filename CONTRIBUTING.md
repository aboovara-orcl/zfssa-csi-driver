# Contributing

Oracle welcomes contributions to this repository from anyone. If you want to submit a pull request to fix a bug or enhance code, please first open an issue and link to that issue when you submit your pull request. If you have any questions about a possible contribution, feel free to open an issue too.

## Opening issues

For bugs or enhancement requests, please file a GitHub issue unless it's
security related. When filing a bug remember that the better written the bug is,
the more likely it is to be fixed. If you think you've found a security
vulnerability, do not raise a GitHub issue and follow the instructions in our
[security policy](./SECURITY.md).

This can be automatically added to pull requests by committing with:

```

Only pull requests from committers that can be verified as having
signed the OCA can be accepted.
